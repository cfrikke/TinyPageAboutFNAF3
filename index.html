        <h3>Notes on FNAF3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 3-5 animatronics. (I believe there's 3, but I'm not 100% sure)
             <li>Only one of those animatronics can kill you. His name is Springtrap â–º </li>
                <li>There are no doors to close, instead you must lure Springtrap away with an auditory lure</li>
                <li>You must also periodically reboot 3 functions. You may reboot the function, or you may reboot all of them at the same time</li>
                <li>Those 3 funtions include the ventilation, cameras, and the audio</li>
                <li>Although none of the phantom animatronics can kill you, they will still jumpscare you</li>
                <li>If you don't reboot the ventilation, you will die of oxygen loss</li>
                <li>Audio lures only affect Springtrap if the audio lure is 1 room away. Playing audio in the same room as Springtrap will anger him</li>
            </ul>
